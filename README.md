# Computer Vision - Based Eye Diseases Identification
  
  It is an AI-based system that analyzes eye images (like retinal scans) to identify diseases such as cataracts, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and macular degeneration. It uses machine learning—especially deep learning with CNNs—to automatically detect abnormalities, helping in early diagnosis and treatment. This technology improves accuracy, saves time, and supports ophthalmologists in clinical decision-making.

  our project displays in a web page to detect what type of eye diseases is affected.
